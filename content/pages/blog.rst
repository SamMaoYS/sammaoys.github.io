These blogs are written for fun. I want to record the contents, resources, and codes I read during my spare time, to help me understand the fundation knowledge and the state-of-the-art papers better, and also improve my English, and technical writing skills. As there are many interesting and great works out there, and new papers coming out everyday, I will try to update the blogs on the daily basis.

`Real-Time Rendering <{filename}/blog/real-time_rendering.rst>`_
=================================================================

I am quite interested in Computer Graphics, an I want to learn more about how to render high-quality contents in real-time. Thus, I am planning to read the book |Real-Time Rendering, forth edition|_ in my spare time, and writing this blog to record the learning progress. The blogs include the summary of the sections in the book, the resources that I think are useful for better understanding the contents, and some code that I write to implement the techiques that are described in the book.

`NeRFs <{filename}/blog/nerfs.rst>`_
======================================

NeRFs (Neural Radiance Fields) are quite popular in the Computer Vision and Computer Graphics fields, as it is end-to-end learnable and can be plugged into many fields and sovle various tasks involves 3D data. These blogs contains various NeRFs related papers, especially on using NeRFs on recontructing and understanding dynamic objects and scenes.
